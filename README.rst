GREWGG : Grain REfinement With General Geometry
===============================================

Jon Wright, 2018

Grewgg is intended to fit 3DXRD data from 2D area detectors using a
generalised description of the experimental geometry. It should
do similar things to FitAllB or makemap.py within ImageD11. A new
package is created due to the departure from the standard FABLE
geometry model.

Features:
- Multiple detectors
- Moving diffractometers for XRD-CT
- More than one rotation axis, if only one at a time
- Geometry description should be input and not hardcoded    
- Estimation of errors
